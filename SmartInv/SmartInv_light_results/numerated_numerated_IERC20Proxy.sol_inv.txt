To identify where invariants should be inserted, we need to have a clear understanding of the specific requirements and constraints of the smart contract. Invariants are typically used to enforce certain rules or conditions that must always hold true within the contract.

Without specific details about the contract's functionality, it is challenging to determine the exact line numbers where invariants should be inserted. However, common areas for inserting invariants include input validation, state constraints, and data consistency checks.

If you can provide more information about the contract's logic or requirements, I can help identify the appropriate line numbers for inserting invariants.Feel free to share any specific constraints or rules that need to be enforced within the contract.
