Invariants associated with the smart contract after line 46+ are as follows:

46+ assert(curves[curveId] != address(0)); // Ensure that the curve does not already exist for the given currency pair

Please note that this invariant ensures that a new curve is being created and not overwriting an existing curve for the same currency pair.
