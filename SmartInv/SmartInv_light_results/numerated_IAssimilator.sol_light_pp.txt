25+, 38+ 

Potential invariants should be inserted at line numbers 25 and 38 in the smart contract. These invariants can help ensure that the intakeNumeraire and outputNumeraire functions are properly handling the amounts and balances of numeraire in the contract. By adding invariants at these points, developers can prevent potential bugs or vulnerabilities related to handling numeraire amounts in the contract.
