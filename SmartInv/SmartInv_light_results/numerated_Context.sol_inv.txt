In this provided smart contract, there are no specific lines where invariants should be inserted. Invariants are usually used to enforce certain conditions that must always hold true throughout the execution of the smart contract. Since this contract is abstract and serves to provide information about the current execution context, there may not be any specific invariants that need to be enforced within this contract.
