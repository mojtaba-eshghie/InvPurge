There are no specific line numbers provided, so it is not possible to identify where invariants should be inserted in the smart contract code. Invariants are typically used to ensure that certain conditions remain true throughout the execution of the contract, so it is important to identify specific points in the code where such conditions need to be maintained. If specific line numbers or conditions are provided, I can generate invariants accordingly.
