There are no specific line numbers provided in the smart contract to analyze for potential invariants. Therefore, without the actual code to review, I am unable to identify the line numbers where potential invariants should be inserted. If you provide the specific smart contract code after <code>, I would be happy to assist with identifying where invariants should be added.
