Invariants should be inserted to 17+, 53+, 66+, 70+, 85+, 95+, 100+, 127+

The invariants are as follows:

17+ assert(address(LP_ADDRESS_PROVIDER) != address(0));
53+ assert(address(getLp()) != address(0));
66+ assert(amount > 0);
70+ assert(want.allowance(address(this), address(lp)) >= amount);
85+ assert(balanceOf() >= 0);
95+ assert(_amount != type(uint256).max);
100+ assert(lp.withdraw(address(want), _amount, msg.sender) == _amount);
127+ assert(!isActive());
