The invariants associated with the smart contract after the specified line numbers are as follows:

42+ assert(interval yieldDiff == yieldChangePerSecondFP * timeDiff);
54+ assert(interval yieldFP == _yieldFP - min(_yieldFP, yieldDiff) || interval yieldFP == _yieldFP + yieldDiff);
70+ assert(interval newSpeed == (speed * oldSpeedWeight + updateAmount * updateWeight) / (oldSpeedWeight + updateWeight));
75+ assert(interval newLastAction == block.timestamp);

Please ensure to adjust the syntax and variable names according to the contract you are analyzing.
