The invariants associated with line 10+ in the smart contract can be:

```solidity
10+ assert(Old(USDC.balanceOf(address(pair))/WETH.balanceOf(address(pair))) == USDC.balanceOf(address(pair))/WETH.balanceOf(address(pair)));
```

Please note that the actual variables and conditions to be asserted against may vary based on the context and logic of the smart contract.
