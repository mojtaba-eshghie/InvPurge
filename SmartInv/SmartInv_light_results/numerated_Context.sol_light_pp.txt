There are no specific lines in the provided smart contract where invariants should be inserted. Invariants are typically used to enforce certain conditions that must always hold true throughout the execution of the smart contract. In this case, since the code provided is an abstract contract that provides information about the execution context, there may not be any specific invariants that need to be enforced within this contract.
