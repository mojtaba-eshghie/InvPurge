There are several places where potential invariants should be inserted in the smart contract. Here are the line numbers:

15+. Invariant to ensure that the contract's total token supply does not exceed a certain limit.

18+. Invariant to ensure that the amount burned does not exceed the sender's balance.

26+. Invariant to ensure that the sender has enough allowance to burn tokens on behalf of the recipient.

28+. Invariant to ensure that the amount burned does not exceed the recipient's balance.
