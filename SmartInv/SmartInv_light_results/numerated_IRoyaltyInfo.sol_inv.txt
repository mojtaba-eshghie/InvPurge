In this specific smart contract, there are no specific lines where invariants need to be inserted. The purpose of this contract is to serve as an interface for EIP-2981 related functions, specifically related to NFT royalties. Since the contract does not contain any state variables or functions that require validation or consistency checks, there is no need to add invariants in this case.
