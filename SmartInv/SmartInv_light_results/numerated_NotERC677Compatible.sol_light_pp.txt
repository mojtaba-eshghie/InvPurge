There are no specific lines in the provided smart contract where invariants should be inserted. Invariants are typically used to enforce certain conditions that must always hold true throughout the execution of the contract. In this case, since the provided smart contract is a simple contract with a constructor function and no state variables or complex logic, there are no specific conditions that need to be enforced using invariants.
