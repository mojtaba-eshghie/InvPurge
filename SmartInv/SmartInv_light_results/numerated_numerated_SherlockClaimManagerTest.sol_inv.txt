Since the provided smart contract is mainly for testing purposes and does not involve complex state changes or calculations that require invariants, it may not be necessary to insert invariants in this specific context. Invariants are typically used to enforce specific conditions or constraints that must hold true throughout the execution of a smart contract to ensure its integrity and security.

If you have a different smart contract with relevant context where specific conditions need to be enforced through invariants, please provide that information for further analysis and generating appropriate invariants.
