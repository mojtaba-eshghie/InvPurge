There are no specific places in the provided smart contract where invariants should be inserted. Invariants are typically used to enforce certain conditions that need to hold true throughout the execution of the contract. Since this contract is a testing contract for viewing storage variables and functions, the addition of invariants may not be necessary for its intended purpose.
