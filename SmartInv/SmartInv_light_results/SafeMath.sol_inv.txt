Invariants for the given smart contract after <code> are as follows:

3+ 
assert(Old(lastRoundAssets) + shares.mulDivDown(lastSharePrice) == lastRoundAssets)

9+ 
require(WETH != address(0), "WETH address cannot be zero");
require(USDC != address(0), "USDC address cannot be zero");

15+
assert(USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) >= 0);
assert(WETH.balanceOf(address(pair)) >= 0);
