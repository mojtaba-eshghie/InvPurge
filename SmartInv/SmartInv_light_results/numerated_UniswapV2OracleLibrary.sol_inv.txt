The invariant for line 10+ in the smart contract would be:

10+ require(USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) > 0, "USDC balance must be greater than 0");
11+ require(WETH.balanceOf(address(pair)) > 0, "WETH balance must be greater than 0");

These invariants ensure that the balances of USDC and WETH tokens in the pair contract are always greater than 0 before performing any calculations.
