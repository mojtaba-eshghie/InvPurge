Since the provided smart contract is an interface with function declarations only and no implementation details, there are no specific lines where invariants should be inserted. Invariants are typically used in the implementation of functions to enforce certain conditions that must always hold true throughout the execution of the contract. As a result, there are no invariants to insert in this scenario.
