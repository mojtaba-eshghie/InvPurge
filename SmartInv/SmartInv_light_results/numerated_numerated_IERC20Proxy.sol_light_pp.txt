There is no specific code provided after <code> to determine the exact line numbers where invariants should be inserted in the smart contract. Invariants are typically used to enforce certain rules or conditions that must always hold true within the contract. 

To identify where invariants should be inserted, it is important to consider the specific requirements and business logic of the contract. Common areas for inserting invariants include input validation, state constraints, and ensuring consistency of data.

If you have specific requirements or conditions that need to be enforced in the smart contract, please provide additional information so that I can help identify the appropriate line numbers for inserting invariants.
