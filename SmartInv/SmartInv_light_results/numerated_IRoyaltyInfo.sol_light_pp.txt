There are no specific lines in the provided smart contract where invariants should be inserted. Invariants are typically used to enforce certain conditions on the state of the contract and ensure that it behaves as intended. In this case, since the contract is an interface for EIP-2981 related functions, it may not require invariants for data integrity or consistency checks.
