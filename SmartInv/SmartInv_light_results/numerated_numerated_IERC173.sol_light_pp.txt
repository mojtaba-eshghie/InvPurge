There are no specific lines in the provided code where invariants should be inserted. Invariants are typically used to establish rules or conditions that must always hold true throughout the execution of the smart contract. In this case, the smart contract is an interface for the ERC-173 Contract Ownership Standard, which defines functions for transferring ownership of a contract. 

However, it is important to ensure that the transferOwnership function includes proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized changes in ownership. This can be implemented using require statements to check if the caller has the necessary permission to transfer ownership. Additionally, it is recommended to include checks for valid input parameters, such as ensuring that the new owner address is not address(0) to prevent accidental renunciation of ownership. 

Therefore, while no specific line numbers were identified for inserting invariants, it is crucial to carefully review the implementation of the transferOwnership function and add appropriate conditions to maintain the integrity and security of the contract.
